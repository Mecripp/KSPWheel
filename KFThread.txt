KerbalFoundries - Continued

(link to KF logo)

This is the main development and release thread for the continuation of KerbalFoundries, originally created by Lo-Fi and Galidaas, continued under new development with explicit permissions from the original authors and under the terms of the original licensing.

This mod adds a variety of new parts to KSP that include wheels, tracks, and anti-gravity repulsors.

For a list of features available to the wheels in this mod, please see the KSPWheels documentation ( link to KSPWheel wiki ).

Tweakscale is not needed or supported (though you should be able to have it installed without problem, the wheels will not use TS for scaling).  Scaling of the parts is accomplished through the KSPWheel plugin's native scaling support, and includes configurable scale powers for all scaled variables (rpm, load handling, motor power output).

A set of patches are included that convert the stock wheels to use the KSPWheel system.  This is a potentially game-breaking patch and should only be enabled prior to starting of a new save game.  This patch must be explicitly enabled by the user by changing the files .disabled extension into a standard .cfg extension.

Change log:
* 2.0.0.1 (01/15/17)
  * Initial release of KF-C

  
Known Issues:


Future Plans:
* Add support for Adjustable Landing Gear models; will need recompiles of the models as well as additional PartModules to handle the customization of the parts and drive the manual animations.
* Add a selection of landing legs for standard landers.
* Add a selection of helicopter style rotors.
* Add a selection of airplane style propellers
* Add a selection of VTOL / airship / hovercraft style ducted fans.
* Add alternate and optional 'ICE' engine handling -- uses lfo/ox/intake air, with torque curves and gearing more suitable to an ICE engine.
(WIP) Adjustable Landing Gear models and art assets are modified from the original versions (created by BahamutoD) and redistributed under permission of license (CC-BY-SA).
