# KSPWheel
Replacement for U4 wheel collider, geared for use in KSP.

## Libraries
This repository includes libraries from both Unity and KSP.  I have no clue on the legal status for redistribution of these libraries.  If there are problems I will remove them from the repository, at which point users must supply their own libraries.

## Source Code
Source code for this project is currently licensed under All-Rights Reserved; please ask if you wish to make use of this code.  Once initial development has finished it will be released under the most appropriate liberal open-source license(s) that I can find (aiming to not cause any license issues with any re-use; might even just become public domain).

## Example Assets
